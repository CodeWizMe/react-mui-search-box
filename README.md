# react-mui-startapp

Building a React app with TypeScript and Material Design

## Create React App
The easiest, and most recommended way, is using the create-react-app command:
```
npx create-react-app react-ts-mui-app --template typescript
```

you should replace the `react-ts-mui-app` in yours app name

Once the app has been created, navigate to its folder location and start it to ensure there are no errors
```
cd react-ts-mui-app
`npm strat
```

## Add Material Design UI
install the Material-UI libraries
```
npm install @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons @types/material-ui
```
The above command installed three libraries:
1. @material-ui/core for the React components 
2. @material-ui/icons for the Material icons
3. @types/material-ui for the type definitions of Material-UI

## Add Application Routes
The React Router is a collection of navigational components to be used in the React applications. 
It enables us to create different routes based on the content of the pages.
To install it and its type definitions on your app, run the following npm command:
```
npm install react-router-dom @types/react-router-dom
```
